====

In advance of the DesignShop, all participants are requested to post here a 1 or 2 page topics paper to be shared with other attendees on either:
* A specific problem that you'd like to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (pgp or ca-based pki) can't address the problem?
* A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

These papers include:
* [Linked Local Names](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/linked-local-names.md) â€” by Christopher Allen ChristopherA@LifeWithAlacrity.com
