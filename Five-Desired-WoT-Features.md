# Five Desirable Features for the Next Generation Web of Trust

by David Strayhorn

**STATUS: UNFINISHED FIRST DRAFT**

## Abstract

I propose five desirable features for a web of trust-based ratings and reputation system of the future: flexibility, simplicity of the user interface, privacy, monetizability, and portability.

## Introduction 

Ratings and reputation systems of contemporary social networks like eBay, Reddit, Amazon, Yelp, etc leave much to be desired. In this article I present five highly desired features that are lacking in the current state of the art but which must be envisioned in the next generation WoT. 

These five features -- flexibility, simplicity of the user interface, privacy, monetizability, and portability -- can be understood as flowing from and being inspired by the single organizing principle: **The end-user must be the ultimate steward and owner of his or her own data.** One of the best tools to design and envision putting this principle into practice is to imagine recreating contemporary social networks so that they exist on a purely peer-to-peer network, eg the reincarnation of eBay as OpenBazaar where no centralized authority exists who could take control of user data. However, there is no reason that these five features could not be implemented by an old fashioned centralized website. For the sake of illustration, I will discuss how each feature might be implemented in the specific case of a (centralized) Reddit-style bulletin board to address one of the most vexing problems of many social networks: ***trolls***. For the sake of this article, this hypothetical bulletin board will be named "arranarr," short for R 'n' R (ratings and reputation).

## Features

#### 1. Flexibility / Customizability: *The end-user must have exquisite control over the cagorizations, labels, algorithms for generation of composite scores, and other aspects of the ratings and reputation system.*

Reputation systems of today are defined centrally, are inflexible, and create scores using algorithms that are frequently opaque. But the end-users' needs will vary over time, from community to community, from user to user, and even within the same user but from one context to another. In the WoT of the future, the end-user will have the ability to create new ways to rate products/users/content – new ’labels’ – as well as new ways to analyze the data.

***Bulletin board example:*** Suppose a user comes up with the idea of two new cagories of users: Trolls, who do what trolls do, and Troll Spotters, whose job is to flag users who exhibit troll-like behaviour. The purpose is to establish an automated system to filter out content generated by anyone in the Troll category. But instead of flagging each and every Troll by hand, each user maintains a conceivably relatively small and simple list of trusted Troll Spotters and stipulates that anyone flagged as a Troll by a Troll Spotter will be treated as a Troll by you. Flags generated by anyone else are ignored. If desired, the option will exist to make a more complicated algorithm (e.g. that at least two Troll Spotters must flag a user before that user is treated as a Troll).  These concepts (Troll, Troll Spotter, and the associated algorithm) are broadcast publicly so that other users will start using them. Users who choose to do so place add these concepts to their default settings. Just like a subreddit, these concepts either gain widespread usage or they don’t. If not, no harm done.

#### 2. Simplicity of User Interface: *The WoT needs to be simple for the casual or beginner end user to use, despite the complexities introduced by the various other desired features (primarily flexibility).*

One may think it will be impossible to make a WoT both simple and flexible, because flexibility will introduce too many complications. The solution to this problem is summed up in two words: *default settings*.

***Bulletin board example:*** One of the most important jobs of the creaters of arranarr will be to do their best to populate default settings of new users with useful concepts like those of the troll system described above. New users can start using the network without necessarily having any idea that making new concepts is even possible. For those users who are interested, they can make new concepts which other users can incorporate into their default settings. New users have the option of adopting either the default settings, adopting from a list of "most popular" settings, or adopting the settings used by someone they know or trust. ***Casual users inherit default settings. Only the sophisticated and interested users need get under the hood.***

#### 3. Monetizability: *The end user will be the one to monetize his or her data, and will have a myriad of strategies to do so.*

The primary business model for many if not most online social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn, eBay) depends in one way or another on the centralized control of your data. LinkedIn offers a more detailed view of connected user profiles, more details about local WoT topology, and more in exchange for a paid membership. Product rating sites including Amazon, eBay, Netflix, Yelp, AngiesList make use of user-supplied ratings to enhance the overall utility of their site and attract users. Facebook mines your personal data to make money through targeted advertising. The WoT of the future must turn this business model on its head. By giving the end user control over their data, it will be only natural that the end user should make money from that. Based on market caps, we should expect that to be worth quite a lot. The question is how *exactly* that will come about.

***Bulletin board example:*** A Troll Spotter should have the option of giving his ratings away or selling them, perhaps for a microfee. Suppose a bulletin board has 20 million unique users per month (which is what Reddit reports). A Troll Spotter on arranarr could charge 10 cents per week in bitcoin for up-to-the-minute access to his ratings; any user who requests data . Assuming that only 10 percent of users subscribe, this market could support 1000 Troll Spotters working full time to ferret out trolls, each one making on average 2000 dollars per week, 100k per year.

#### 4. Privacy: *The end user must have exquisite control over privacy settings.*

In order to monetize data, the end user must have exquisite control over which data gets sent to which users and under what circumstances.

#### 5. Portability: *Identity and reputation must be readily portable between one social network and the next.*

Many pieces of data generated on one social network will be useful on other social networks. For example, a troll on another social network will probably be a troll on arranarr. A useful script will be one that amalgamates multiple ratings of a given user across multiple networks and come up with a single composite score. However, a major barrier is that there is a lack of uniformity between networks. One network may rate products on a 0-5 scale called "Quality"; another, on a 1-5 scale called something else. 

User identities can be ported across networks using cryptographic identifiers provided by services like OneName. If a user makes use of the same identifier across multiple networks (and many users will want to do this), then it becomes possible for reputational data to follow that identity across networks. 

***Bulletin board example:*** When a concept such as Troll, Troll Spotter, etc is generated on arranarr, a complete specification of each concept will be constructed (eg in json format) and it will be given a cryptographic identifier, will be signed by its author, and (if desired) will be posted to a public data repository. This will allow the concept to be imported into another network (by the creator of that network or by a user within that network), so that there can be uniformity across networks. Other pieces of data, including statements of individual ratings ("Bob says Alice is not a Troll") will also be given cryptographic identifiers. 

#### ? 6. Automatability: *There must be methods to calculate composite scores.*

It is too cumbersome for the user to wade through individual ratings one at a time.
